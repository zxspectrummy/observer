## Rename Script

Displays a dry run list of files that will be renamed(from, to). RUN THIS FIRST to verify correct operation.

~~~~
python media_filename_update.py go

Completes the rename.

Covers all data change that is simply the result of a rename or moving.

If file data changes as well as a rename, the rename will happen first but rsync will then update the file anyway.
